# Minifig Project - Tivix recruitment task

## Setup

In order to run this project run

```bash
npm install
```

Then, when android device/emulator is ready run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This should start Metro initialize CLI inside terminal. After initialization, press `a` button to open project on Android device.

As I was not able to develop on Mac, this project is not set up for iOS devices. Please stick to Android, thanks! :)
