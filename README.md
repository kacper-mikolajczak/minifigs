# Minifig Project - Tivix recruitment task

## Setup

### Environment variables

Required env are defined in `.example.env`. In order to run project, first just copy&pase its content to `.env`. Hopefully this precious API key won't leak anywhere :D

### Installation

In order to run this project run

```bash
npm install
```

Then, when android device/emulator is ready run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This should start Metro initialize CLI inside terminal. After initialization, press `a` button to open project on Android device.

### Caveats

As I was not able to develop on Mac, this project is not set up for iOS devices. Please stick to Android, thanks! :)
